Hello,
this is my first racing game.
I hope you have much fun with this game.

You are able to create your own maps.
You should pay attention to some things.:

Colours:                                    Paintbrush:
Street = (100, 100, 100, 255)     #646464   - width = 75
Fence = (255, 5, 5, 255)          #FF0505   - Width = 5
Finish line = (255, 255, 5, 255)  #FFFF05   - Width = 5

Start positions:
blue car: x = 100 Y = 165  (from 100 to 120)
red car : x = 100 Y = 195  (from 165 to 215)

The PNG-file must be called "track_" + Number + ".png"

-blue car:
    arrow keys

-red car:
    WASD
